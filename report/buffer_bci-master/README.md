# Buffer BCI

Buffer BCI is a platform independent and language agnostic framework
for building Brain Computer Interface experiements.  It is based on a
*client-server architecture* with multiple clients getting and putting
data to a centeral data and events server.  The server is based on the
[fieldtrip buffer](http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/development/realtime)
specificitation for data access and storage. 

The server is available for Mac, Linux and Windows and language
bindings are provided the following programming languages Matlab,
Octave, Java, Python, C\# and c.  For Matlab and Octave additional
signal-analysis, classification and example demonstration BCIs are
provided.  A summary of the language feature support is:
* C#, java, Python, c : support for accessing data and events
* Octave : with Octave_java, support for accessing data and events. Support of processing of data.  Graphics supportd depends on the graphics toolkit available, viz. Qthandles=full support, fltk=data visualization, gnuplot=no graphics.
* Matlab : R>7.4, full support for accessing data and events, signal analysis, data visualization and GUI control.

## Important Note:

This is a *client-server architecture*.  Thus to use any of the demos or run time you need at least:
1) a server running (the 'buffer') and two clients: 
2) a data-acquisation client which interfaces with the hardware to send data to the server, 
3) an application client which does something with the received data, like showing it on the screen.

Further different clients may be written in different programming languages and hence have different dependences.  As a minimum many of the clients interfacing with signal measurement hardware are written in java (specificially: the MUSE and openBCI clients) hence you will need a working java run-time to use these devices.  Further, most of the demonstration systems are written in Matlab/Octave, so you will need to install these systems to run these demos â€“ though check the java, python and csharp directories for demonstrations written in those languages.

## Installation

Copy these directories somewhere on your local drive.

Note: If using MATLAB/Octave and the .bat/.sh files do not work because the MATLAB/Octave executable is not found automatically then modify the path in the file `utilities\findMatlab.bat` (windows) or `utilities/findMatlab.sh` (Linux/MacOSX) to point to the executable location.

Note2: For Linux there is a [Docker image]( https://github.com/dokterbob/docker-bci) which can be used to simply install buffer_bci and all it's dependencies directly 

Note3: *MacOS* to run the *.sh files from the finder you need to set them to open with the *Terminal* application (which is in the utilities sub-directory of applications).  Set this by Control-clicking any .sh file and choosing 'Open With' then browse to the *Terminal* application and choose open all .sh files this way.

## QuickStart

Read the readme.txt file in either of the games, EEGBCITutorial, imaginedMovement, matrixSpeller directories for instructions on how to startup and run
those demos.  (Note: all demos require Matlab/Octave_java+QtHandles to
run correctly!)

To run the games demo:

1. Start the data Acquisation system.

 If you have *no* EEG hardware, but just want to test:

  1.2) start a buffer by running: `dataAcq/startBuffer.bat` or `dataAcq/startBuffer.sh`  
  1.2) start a *simulated* data source by running: `dataAcq/startSignalProxy.bat` or .sh

 If you have EEG hardware connected then depending on the hardware:

  1.1) start a buffer by running: `dataAcq/startBuffer.bat` or `buffer/startBuffer.sh`  
  1.2) start appropriate acquisition driver for your device:  
  		 TMSi Mobita([mobita]):       `dataAcq/startMobita.bat`  or  `dataAcq/startMobita.sh`  
       Emotiv Epoc:        `dataAcq/startEmotiv.bat`  or  `dataAcq/startEmotiv.sh`  
       Biosemi Active 2:   `dataAcq/startBiosemi.bat` or  `dataAcq/startBiosemi.sh`  
		 Interaxon Muse:     `dataAcq/startMuse.bat`    or  `dataAcq/startMuse.sh`  

Note: By default raw data is saved to:  
*  *MacOS/Linux*: `~/output/test/_YYMMDD_/_HHMM_/raw_buffer/0001`  
*  *Windows*: `C:\output\test\_YYMMDD_\_HHMM_\raw_buffer\0001`  
   where `_YYMMDD_` is the date in year/month/day format, `_HHMM_` is start time hour and minutes

2. Start the Matlab/Octave based signal processing process by running: `games/startSigProcBuffer.bat` or .sh

3. Start the Matlab/Octave based experiment control & stimulus presentation system by running : `games/runGame.bat` or runGame.sh

4. Type in the subject name to the experiment control window, and then run through each of the experiment phases: 

  * Practice -- practice the task to be used in the BCI.  Green arrows indicate target locations you should attend to by counting the white and red arrow 'flashes'

  * Calibration -- get calibration data by attending as instructed for ~90seconds

  * Classifier Training -- train a classifier using the calibration data.  3 windows will pop-up showing: Per-class ERPs, per-class AUCs, and cross-validated classification performance.

5. Select the game you would like to play!

###Notes: TMSi mobita {mobita}
This device uses wifi to connect between the computer and the amplifier.  When recording data this connection *cannot* be disconnected.  Unfortunately, most OSs currently have a wifi auto-scan system which will periodically scan for 'better' wifi networks.  This scanning will interrupt data sending and cause the connection to be temporally lost for 1-3seconds.   To prevent this you need to prevent wifi auto-scanning, how this is done differs depending on OS.
* Linux: on most current linux wifi is managed by NetworkManager.  By stopping this process from running you can prevent wifi auto-scanning.  Do this by: `killall -STOP NetworkManager`.  To resume auto-scanning use: `killall -CONT NetworkManager`
* Windows: to stop network scanning follow the instructions [here](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/how-to-disable-automatic-scanning-for-wifi/4c8253ec-40c6-42c8-a9f7-00d78fce966c).


###Notes: Linux 64-bit
Currently this system comes only with 32-bit linux binary executables in the
`dataAcq\buffer\glnx86` directory.  These depend on the 32-bit version of the
standard libraries and thus will not work on 64-bit systems which do not have
these libaries installed.   Fortunately these libaries are easy to install on
modern linux systems.  Exactly how will vary depending on the distribution,
however on Ubuntu you should take the following steps:

1) *Do not* install `ia32-libs` as this is no longer uspported.   Instead
install the 3 packages: `lib32z1` `lib32ncurses5` `lib32bz2-1.0`

2) Add all the additional information for the 32-bit architecture using:
`sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`

3) (Optional) For Emotiv Epoc support using *emokit* reinstall `mcrypt` as `mcrypt:i386`
